This dataset is used in the paper "Learning-based EEG Rhythm Analysis and Kernel Filter Design for MI-BCI Optimization" for testing and optimizing the EhythmNET network. 
The dataset includes experimental data targeting motor imagery (MI-BCI) tasks, with a total of five participants. 
All data were collected at different time intervals under strictly controlled experimental settings to ensure reliability and consistency.
